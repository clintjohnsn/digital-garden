A **manifold** is a [[topological space]] that locally resembles [[euclidean space]] near each point. an n-dimensional manifold is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is **homeomorphic** to an open subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space.

A d-dimensional space is said to be a **manifold** if and only if at each point there exists a neighborhood that is **homeomorphic** to d-dimensional Euclidean space, R <sup>d</sup> .
