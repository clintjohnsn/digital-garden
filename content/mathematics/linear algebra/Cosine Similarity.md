cosine of the angle between 2 vectors. It is the magnitude normalized dot product of 2 vectors.

**cosine**(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>) = (x<sub>1</sub> .  x<sub>2</sub>)/ |x<sub>1</sub>| |x<sub>2</sub>|

where, |x<sub>1</sub>| = sqrt(x<sub>1</sub> . x<sub>1</sub>) is the magnitude of x<sub>1</sub>
