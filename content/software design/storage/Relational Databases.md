- **SQL** (Structured Query Language) based databases
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, â€¦
- Has a **fixed schema**, which can be modified later but requires downtime. So, careful schema design is required beforehand
- Easily **vertically scalable** - more entities can be added. Horizontal scaling (adding more attributes to entities) is hard, requires complex [[Sharding]]
- **Reliable** 
	- Relational databases are great for **transactional**  data
	- [[ACID]] compliant
	- reduces anomalies
