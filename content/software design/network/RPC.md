**Remote Procedure Call**

- A form of **inter-process communication** in [[Distributed Systems]]
- Protocol that allows a process to call a subroutine on a remote server over a network. 
- The idea is to abstract the details of the network communication so that a client program can request a function from a server program as if it were a local procedure call
- e.g. [[gRPC]]
