title: Welcome to my Digital Garden!

Hi there! 👋

I’m a software engineer🧑‍💻 based in the UK, pursuing a Masters degree🎓 at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

This is my [_Digital Garden_](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), a working collection of notes on AI🧠 and Software Design✨. I’ve been building this wiki since late 2023 as a way to

- write and learn
- organize and reflect on thoughts and learnings
- draw connections and parallels and ponder on new ones

You may look around using the explorer, the graph view, or these starting points:

- [[Artificial Intelligence]]
- [[Machine Learning]]
- [[Software Design]]
