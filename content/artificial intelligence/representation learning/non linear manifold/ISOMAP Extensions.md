- [[Conformal ISOMAP]]
	- relax the convex manifold assumption by preserving manifold orientation instead of geodesic distance. 
- [[C ISOMAP]]
	- allow for magnifying the regions of high density but shrinking the regions of low density of data points in manifold. 
- [[Incremental ISOMAP]]
	- allow for online ISOMAP learning by embedded points one by one instead of training in a batch manner. 
- [[Landmark ISOMAP]]
	- overcome high computational burden in learning by using landmarks, only a subset of representative data.
- [[Robust ISOMAP]]
	- replace Dijkstra path-based geodesic distance estimates with **parallel transport unfolding** approximation for robustness to noise, a fundamental weakness of ISOMAP.
