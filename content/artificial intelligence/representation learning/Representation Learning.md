aka **Feature Learning**

## Data Representation
effective way to encode information underlying data

> in humans the information processing is hierarchical.
### Acquisition Methodology
- Hand-Crafted feature engineering
- Representation learned from data

### Motivation
[[Curse of Dimensionality ]] 
[[Latent Factor]] in [[Manifold]]s

### Supervised Representation Learning
mapping from input to targets
use deep [[Neural Network]]s
### Unsupervised Representation Learning
- [[Dimension Reduction]]
- [[Manifold learning]] 
- density estimation/recovering distribution using [[Generative Models]]
- Disentangling underlying factors of variation via **hybrid learning**
