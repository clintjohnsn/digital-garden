real-world high dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional (sub)manifolds embedded in the high-dimensional space.

**[[Manifold]]**: meaningful low dimensional topological structure of data in high dimensional space

**Manifold Learning**: discover and model low-dimensional manifolds via learning from data to form a low-dimensional latent embedding representation
Recovering/modelling [[Latent Factor]]s

### Rigid vs Non-Rigid Geometry
**Rigid shapes** are invariant in **Euclidean space**, while **inelastic non-rigid shapes** are variant in Euclidean space

**Euclidean distance** (Extrinsic distance) does not work for non-rigid shapes.

But, there is **intrinsic space** for inelastic non-rigid shapes (nonlinear manifold) where its **intrinsic distance** is invariant for any data points in nonlinear manifold.

[[Manifold learning]] : Mapping the **non-rigid shapes** to a latent embedding space where **euclidean distance** works to preserve the **intrinsic distance**.  

i.e.  Model the intrinsic manifold for low-dimensional representation and visualization

###  [[Manifold Interpolation]]
as opposed to linear interpolation

## Types

[[Linear  Manifold Learning]] : Recover linear manifolds
[[Non Linear Manifold Learning]] : Recover non linear manifolds
