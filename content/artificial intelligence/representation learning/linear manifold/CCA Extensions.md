[[Kerner or Deep CCA]]: variables cannot be normalized and display non linear relationships

[[Sparse CCA]]: number of samples greater than number of variables or smaller set of variables better

CCA cannot handle the case where no of samples greater than number of variables - **Kernel/Deep** CCA, **Sparse** CCA and **Probabilistic** CCAs can.
