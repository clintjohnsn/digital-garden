When **X** is known, projecting N points with top **p** PCs achieved from its **covariance matrix** in [[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]] leads to the same embedding results as **cMDS** (up to an arbitrary rotation).
(since covariance matrix and gram matrix share eigenvalues)

[[Proportion of Variance]]
can be used to find optimum intrinsic dimensionality
