dimension reduction techniques that map the distance between observations in a high-dimensional source space into a low-dimensional target space. 

Attempts to learn a configuration of points in target space which preserves the inter-point distance between the corresponding points in source space

MDS only needs to know distance matrix ∆<sub>N×N</sub> which comes from a matrix X of N data points without requiring any information on dimensionality and distance metric in source space
