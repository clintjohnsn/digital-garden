- [[Stress-Based MDS]]
- [[Non-metric MDS (nMDS)]]
	- In many real applications of MDS, dissimilarities are known only by their **rank order**, e.g., alphabetic order
- [[Weighted MDS]]
	- [[Stress-Based MDS]] is extensible to weighted MDS in order to highlight certain aspects of dissimilarities in data
- [[Symbolic MDS]]
	- MDS is extensible to dealing with symbolic data of interval of dissimilarity and distribution (histogram) of dissimilarity instead of distance between two points in metric MDS
- [[Interactive MDS]]
		- An extension of MDS that allows for a completely new, direct, and intuitive interaction with an MDS user on the interplay of the specific dissimilarities in data
#### Out of sample extension
does not provide any mapping function: z = f (x) for unseen data.
> use the known X data and their embedded coordinates Z as training examples to learn a parametric mapping function
> e.g. [[Neural Network]]s or [[Support Vector Regressor]]
