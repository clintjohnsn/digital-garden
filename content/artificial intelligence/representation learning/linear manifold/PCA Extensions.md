- [[Logistic PCA]]
	- allow for dealing with binary and categorical (discrete) input features
- [[Sparse PCA]]
	- overcome a PCA weakness that PCs are usually linear combinations of all the input features by using linear combinations of just a few input variables
- **Nonlinear PCAs**
	- for non linear manifolds
	- [[Principal Curve Analysis]]
- **Robust PCAs**
	- overcome the PCA weakness that PCA is sensitive to outliers in the data that cause large errors, e.g., **weighted PCA**.
- [[Probabilistic PCA]]
	- a stochastic PCA variant (generative model) that explains the PCA process from a data generation perspective
