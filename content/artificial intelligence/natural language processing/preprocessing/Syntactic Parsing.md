address syntactic ambiguity rising from sentence structures - e.g. attachment of **prepositional phrases**

used for [[POS Tagging]]

> prepositional phrases always begin with a preposition

**examples**
- I saw the man on the hill *with* a telescope (with can be attached to me or man)
- The violent police man injures the farmer *with* an ax (with can be attached to farmer or injures)
- John swerved and hit a tree *riding* his bike (riding can be attached to tree or hit)
- Killer sentenced to die *for* second time in 10 years (for can be attached to die or sentenced)
- Flying planes *can* be dangerous (can may be attached to planes or flying)

 attachment/connection/dependencies â†’ modifying/specifying/describing another word which forms the **sentence structure**
## Approaches
- dependency structure based
- phrase structure based

> Depending on the interpretations of where the prepositional phrase is supposed to connect, we get different graphs for both approaches.
