A grammatical construction (like a phrase) is said to be **endocentric** if it fulfils the same linguistic function as one of its parts, and **exocentric** if it does not.

An **endocentric** construction consists of an mandatory [[head]] and one or more **dependents**, whose presence serves to modify the meaning of the head

e.g.
- verb (head) and its adverb (dependent) 
	- running fast
- noun (head) and its adjective (dependent)
	- a big house

> without the dependent, it still would make sense

An **exocentric** construction consists of two or more parts, whereby the one or the other of the parts cannot be viewed as providing the bulk of the semantic content of the whole

> without the dependents, it would not make sense

e.g.
- subject verb object 
	- Hannibal destroyed Rome
