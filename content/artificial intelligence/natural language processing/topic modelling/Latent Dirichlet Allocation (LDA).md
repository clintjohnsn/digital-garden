- unsupervised [[Topic Modelling]] algorithm
- [[Generative]] statistical model
- **Assumptions**
	- each document is a mixture of topics 
	- each word is attributable to at least one of the topics
- number of topics **k** to be pre-defined
- Output
	- list of words (ranked by probability) associated with a topic of interest
	- probability that a word of interest is associated with a topic
	- proportion of a document that pertains to a topic
	- does not output the topic itself
