Many people think that A.I. will create more unemployment, and bring up [[Universal Basic Income]], as a solution to that problem. It would be different if we already had universal basic income, but we don’t, so expressing support for it seems like a way for the people developing A.I. to pass the buck to the government. In effect, they are intensifying the problems that capitalism creates with the expectation that, when those problems become bad enough, the government will have no choice but to step in. This is actually [[Accelerationism]] - the way to move beyond capitalism is to stomp on the gas pedal of [[Neoliberalism]] until the engine explodes.
