- partition image to segments
- group pixels with similar visual characteristics
	- the specificity or scale is dependent on the domain
- segmentation in humans
	- likely to be different
	- subjective
	- ill-defined problem
- For gray images
	- [[Binary Segmentation]]
	- [[Active Contours]]
## Theory
- [[Gestalt Psychology]]
## Approaches
- **Top-down**
	- pixels belong together because they come from the same object
	- in line with [[Gestalt Psychology]]
- **Bottom-up**
	- pixels belong together because they look similar
	- Most techniques are bottom-up
### Clustering based
- Cluster pixels based on its visual characteristics
- Each pixel can be seen as a feature vector of 
	- brightness
	- colour (R,G,B channels)
	- position
	- depth
	- motion
	- texture
	- material
- Map the pixels into a feature space 
- Pixel Similarity 
	- Dissimilarity or distance between features → [[L2 Norm]]
- Using pixel similarity/dissimilarity, cluster the features such that similar pixels cluster together
- each cluster is an image segment
- disjoint regions could belong to the same cluster
	- using position as a feature could discourage this
- Algorithms
	- [[K-means Clustering]] based segmentation
	- **Model-Free** : [[Mean shift Clustering]] based segmentation
	- **Probabilistic** : [[Gaussian Mixture Models]] based segmentation
		- **foreground-background classification**
			- pixels are background most of the time. So gaussians with large scale **ω** and small **σ** are background.
			- take the ratio of **ω/σ**
#### Graph based
- images as graphs → G = (V,E)
	- a vertex for each pixel, and its features, like in clustering
	- an edge → weighted by the **affinity** or similarity between vertices
- Algorithms
	-  [[Graph Cut Algorithm]] based Segmentation
		- Each subgraph is an image segment
