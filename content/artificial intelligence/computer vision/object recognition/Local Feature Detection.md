### Interest Points
- edges & corners → possible, but not descriptive enough
- **blobs** → patch with a well-defined local appearance
	- possible Interest point 
- interest points
	- capture rich image content
	- localize the points
	- describe them in a signature
	- are invariant to scale and rotation
