- **Image function**
	- I(x,y): A discrete function from R<sup>2</sup> → R 
	- grayscale value becomes the height
	- x,y forms the image plane
- **Landscape** 
	- smoothen the Image function to form a landscape 
	- a smooth continuous image function representation is called a landscape
- **Array of pixels**
- **Image histogram**
	- sort pixels by grayscale value and create a histogram 
	- image is lost (specifically, the spatial information is lost)

### Spatial Resolution 
- level of detail/number of pixels
- commonly what is meant by image resolution
- depends on the **scale** required

### Grey level resolution
- change in the shades/levels of grey
- word length of the grey level
- number of bits per pixel
	- 8bit → 256 shades of grey possible
