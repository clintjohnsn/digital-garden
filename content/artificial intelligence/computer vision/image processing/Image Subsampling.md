- Reduce image  resolution
	- ![[Image Representation#Spatial Resolution]]
- e.g. Throw away every other row and column to create a 1/2 size image
- reduce size of the image by sacrificing some detail (small scale structures)
- Remove noise first by **spatial averaging** (blurring or smoothing), so that we require less pixels to represent the image, i.e. same information in fewer pixels
