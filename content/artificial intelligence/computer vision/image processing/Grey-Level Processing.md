### Image Transformations
- since images are like functions, we can apply transformations
> See [[Image Representation]]
- just like a function, we can apply any arithmetic to an image
	- e.g. adding a constant value to the greyscale will improve brightness
- images can be added or subtracted
	- if in a video the background is static, we can filter out the moving bit by simply subtracting the sequence of images
> See  [[Convolution]]
