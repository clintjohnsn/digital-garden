number of parameters in neural networks used in practice can be pretty large. Particularly, in images.

## Resolution
- [[Early Stopping]]
- **Add data**
	- fake data if getting data is difficult
		- eg Images can be translated slightly, rotated slightly, change of brightness, etc
		- [[Adversarial Training]]
- **Regularization**
	- [[L1 L2 Regularization]] can be used in neural networks too.
	- [[Dropout]]
- [[Gradient Clipping]]
- Hard constraints on weights
- inject noise into the system
- [[Unsupervised Pre-Training]]
- enforce sparsity in the network
