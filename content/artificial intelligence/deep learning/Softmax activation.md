takes as input a vector z of K real numbers, and normalizes it into a probability distribution consisting of K probabilities proportional to the exponentials of the input numbers.  components will add up to 1.

used as final layer of a neural network-based classifier. Such networks are commonly trained under a [[Cross Entropy Error]] regime
