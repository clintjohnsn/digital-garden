- creates optimal decision boundaries in a feature space
	- **Linear decision boundary**: Create a n-1 dimensional decision boundary in a n-dimensional feature space
- **margin**: width that the boundary can be increased by before hitting a point

- find a decision boundary with the maximum margin
- the data points on the margin are called **support vectors**
