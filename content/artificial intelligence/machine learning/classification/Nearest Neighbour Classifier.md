- Find K nearest neighbours of a point, and classify the point on a majority vote of the neighbour classes 
- point Similarity
	- use [[L2 Norm]] as distance
- larger the dataset, more robust the classifier
- brute force approach
	- calculate distance between the new point and every point in the classifier 
	- computationally expensive
