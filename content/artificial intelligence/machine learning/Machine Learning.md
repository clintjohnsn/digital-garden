### Learning Model
A mechanism that encodes “knowledge” for problem solving
### Cost/Loss (Utility) Function
performance criterion for a specific learning goal based on a given parametric learning model and training data to judge how well the parameters of this model are set based on a training dataset.
### Learning Algorithm
optimisation process that minimises (maximises) the cost/loss (utility) function with respect to model parameters
