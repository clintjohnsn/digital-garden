- [[Overfitting]]
- [[Underfitting]]


initially as the number of parameters increases, the **bias** of the model reduces and at one point (the valley) the number of parameters is enough to fit the model and bias is minimum. After this, we see the **variance** of the model increasing again till d ~ n. After that we see that graph descends again for the second time (called the [[double descent phenomenon]]). This part is called the **overparameterized regime**, because here the model is overparameterized with **d > n**
