- labelled data for [[Machine Learning]] tasks
- time and resource intensive/costly to produce
	- might need experts in the domain
	- multiple experts to label a data instance for **reliability** and minimize **bias**
	- labelling or annotation **guidelines** for labelling - to make them **consistent**
	- even with guidelines, experts can label the same thing differently - personal bias. We can use statistical measures such as [[Inter-rater Reliability]] to judge the quality of such a gold standard data.

### Alternative
since it is expensive, other methods can be used to acquire less than perfect data

- [[Weak Supervision]]
- [[Distant Supervision]]
