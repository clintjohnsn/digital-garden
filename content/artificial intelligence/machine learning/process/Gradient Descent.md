![[Linear Regression Gradient Descent]]

#### Feature Scaling
- always normalize/standardize

### How to pick learning rate?

- [[Line search methods]]
- [[Conjugate gradient]]
	- used for quadratic objectives
- [[Newton Search direction]]

### Large datasets

In large datasets, computing gradient gets expensive (since it uses the whole dataset X)
- [[Online Learning]]
- [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]] a.k.a minibatch gradient descent
