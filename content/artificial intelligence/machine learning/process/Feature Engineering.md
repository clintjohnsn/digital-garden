## feature selection
- find correlations and remove uninformative features
- discretize a continuous features (binning)
- visualizations
## feature transformation 
- create new features
- remove dependent features
- find correlations after feature transformation
- combine features
## feature scaling
- [[Normalization]]
- [[Standardization]]
- Use Standardization when - 
	- [[Unsupervised ML]]
	- feature already has a distribution close to a [[Gaussian Distribution]]
	- feature has outliers 
		- since normalization will squeeze all the other (mean like) values
- **Use Normalization otherwise**
